<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>Most of the time anyone wants to send me an email, the proper email address to use is <strong><a href="mailto:joseph@mainusch.net">joseph@mainusch.net</a></strong>.  For exceedingly important emails that contain very sensitive info, my preferred email exchange method is to use one of my alternate email addresses: <strong><a href="mailto:joseph@secure.mainusch.net">joseph@secure.mainusch.net</a></strong>.  This is hosted on Protonmail in Switzerland, and is extremely safe.  If you have a protonmail account, the email will be encrypted end-to-end.  If you&#39;re sending from another service, it will almost certainly be sent encrypted over TLS, but more importantly, upon delivery to my mailbox, it is stored encrypted, and only I have the key.  Not even protonmail could read it.  I also can use Virtru on my gmail (joseph@mainusch.net) account, if you prefer that.</p>
<p>My work email address is <strong><a href="mailto:joe.mainusch@oracle.com">joe.mainusch@oracle.com</a></strong></p>
<h3 id="phone">Phone</h3>
<p>We use cellphones. My personal cellphone number is +1 603 315-0695</p>
<h3 id="direct-messaging">Direct Messaging</h3>
<p>I can be reached through a variety of direct messaging platforms.  You can SMS message me via my phone number above, or better yet, use <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a>, which is very secure.  I&#39;m also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joe.mainusch">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jmainusch">Twitter</a> (which are, of course, not as secure).</p>
